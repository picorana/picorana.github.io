  - name: You Turing Complete Me
    description: Turing Completeness is a set of characteristics that makes any language able to be used to build a Turing machine, therefore to be used to write any program or define another programming language. Such characteristics are so simple that they can be found in unexpected places like videogames. "You Turing Complete Me" is a talk that explores weird Turing Complete places, including Pokémon and Minecraft.

  - name: Hypercar Drifter
    description: Hypercar Drifter is a runner game in which you drive a flying car into a tunnel full of obstacles. As you go, your speed increases and more obstacles are spawned, adding difficulty to the game. If you hit an obstacle, the game is over and you have to restart from the beginning. The goal is to get as far as you can without hitting anything.
