  - name: Persistence of Vision Display
    link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZD25CG7F38
    description: We built a clock that displays a series of arcs representing the time by rotating very fast a single LED strip and giving the illusion that the clock is made by continuous arcs of light. <br> The LEDs are turned on and off with appropriate timing, so thanks to the principle of persistence of vision, the eye is under the impression that what it's seeing is not a strip of LEDs rotating, but a continuous beam. <br> This display was made for the 30th anniversary of Quasar Design University, Rome. <br><br>Click on the link to see a video of the display in action.
