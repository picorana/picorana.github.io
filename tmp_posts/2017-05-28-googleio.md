This year I had the opportunity to attend Google I/O in Mountain View!

Honestly, I never actually even hoped to be able to attend an event of this kind, and I didn't even believe it was really happening until I actually got there.

So, a quick explanation: Google I/O it's a huge developer festival held near the Google campus, in which new technologies and developments by Google are announced. Thousands of people attend, and the tickets are not only very costly, but difficult to get even when you're paying the full price, because they are given out only to randomly chosen buyers.

- networking event, not very educative
- superlative organization
- aspettative?
- alcune foto
- prizes
