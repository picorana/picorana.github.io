  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>So, this year I have been selected for both Google Summer of Code and Outreachy.</p>

<p>Since these are both programs that are very desirable on a Computer Science curriculum, and also very important in a student’s growth, I wanted to publicly share my experience with both programs to encourage anybody who is reading this blog post (if they have the requirements) to apply, and to give an example of an accepted proposal.</p>

<p>Since there is a huge number of guides on how to get accepted and how the application period and the internship period work, this post will be more about my personal experience and what challenges I had to overcome.</p>

<h1 id="overview-of-the-programs">Overview of the programs</h1>
<p>First of all, let me give a little overview about what these programs are:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a></strong> is a program aimed at university students, with the goal of bringing them closer to open source projects and organizations. The program is organized by Google, but within the same program you can chose among a lot of organizations (all of them will propose full open source projects) that you want to contribute to. There are about 200 organizations, and within each one you can choose between different projects that they propose to the applicants. If you are accepted into the program, you will contribute to the selected project in a 3 month internship, 40 hours a week.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.gnome.org/outreachy/">Outreachy</a></strong>, formerly Outreach Program for Women (OPW), is very similar to GSoC, with the main difference that is aimed at minorities, so it is mainly directed towards women and people whose minority is underrepresented in technology. The other difference is that it is held twice a year, while GSoC is only held once.</p>

<p>Google Summer of Code will get its participants from a bigger pool, and therefore, from what I have seen, is more competitive. But the number of accepted interns is also hugely different: while GSoC will accept about 1300 participants, Outreachy accepts about 40. This is also because the number of people who applies to Outreachy is much less.</p>

<p><strong>The stipend:</strong> while Outreachy pays a fixed stipend of 5500$ for the whole three months (plus $500 travel allowance), GSoC changes the pay based on which country you live in, to adjust it to have about the same spending power. For me, living in Italy, the amount I would have received through GSoC is comparable to the one of Outreachy, so this was not a factor in my decision process.</p>

<h1 id="why-should-you-participate">Why should you participate?</h1>
<ul>
  <li>You’ll be working for three months in an organization you like a lot</li>
  <li>You will have the opportunity to participate in a big open source project</li>
  <li>You will have a dedicated mentor to follow you and your work directly</li>
  <li>You will learn a lot!</li>
  <li>It will look nice on your curriculum</li>
  <li>And if all this isn’t enough, you’ll be paid very nicely.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="the-application-period">The application period</h1>
<p>When applying, take into account that applying for these programs is time consuming and takes about a month of work. You can do this while doing other exams, but you should still consider that you need to commit a lot of your time to go through the projects, interact with the mentors and make a first contribution where requested, and you will also have to spend some time refining your proposal.</p>

<p>The application period starts about three months in advance, so you should plan everything early. If you are looking forward to participate in the next summer, you should start looking around at the beginning of March.</p>

<p>The main advice here is to find many organizations to try to apply to, so you have more possibilities of being the top candidate for at least one of them. And to choose projects you really like, and organizations you’re in love with.</p>

<p>This is a risky investment of your time, because you’re not sure if you’ll be chosen or not. You can still consider this as a part of your learning experience, as I can say that the contributions I made during the application period have been formative for me. <strong>Rejection is an important part of anyone’s learning process.</strong></p>

<h1 id="outreachy">Outreachy</h1>
<p>I had already applied for Outreachy once, in October 2016. I ended up not being accepted, but even the experience of not being chosen has been hugely formative for me, and I can recognize what errors I made.</p>

<p>The first thing you are presented with, when applying for a program like this, is a huge list of projects you could contribute to. It’s a bit overwhelming. The projects span over a whole lot of possible fields of knowledge you could or could not have, and many of the projects are challenging, so my first reaction was to feel inadequate.</p>

<p>The hugest part of the application period requires you to get out of your shell and make contact with the mentor. And you are required to make a lot of contact, to make them fall in love with you and your work, so you’ll need to be brave and open up about yourself.</p>

<p>So, my first time, I was shy and not sure if I could fit among the other participants. I was required to compete with people from all around the world, to make contributions to huge projects, to talk to people that to me where incredible. Making my first pull request to a project by Mozilla was scary.</p>

<p>The pull request was accepted, but I was not. I did not lose my hope and in March of this year I tried again.</p>

<p>This time I tried applying with Fedora, and they were looking for a person who could draw because the project was about making a coloring book. I’m confident in my drawing abilities and ended up taking this project in a much more relaxed way. My proposal was accepted, and here you can find the text of it as a reference, so you can have an example of how an accepted proposal looks:</p>
